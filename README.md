# Installation
First of all, to make sure you've got all the librairies installed, run  
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can run ***init.py*** py double-clicking on ***init.ps1*** (only do so after you checked the contents of both files, don't trust everything you got from the internet)

This will create the webtoon.sqlite database
